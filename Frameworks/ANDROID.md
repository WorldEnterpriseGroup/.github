# A.N.D.R.O.I.D. Ops:
ANDROID Ops is a modified DevOps approach that focuses on S.M.A.R.T. (Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Relatable, and Timely) A.N.D.R.O.I.D. (Advance, Network, Design, Research, Optimize, Integrate, Deliver) Operations as 7 phases of project development. Each ANDROID is specialized to one specific purpose and should iterate even faster than a Lean Agile approach. The "Ops" portion focuses heavily on collaboration, communication, creative thinking, and deep cyber security practices.

Staff members choose their own ANDROIDs to ultimately help the organization reach Super Nova events. Their ANDROIDs should latch onto STARs and assist in steering, guiding, and manipulating stars to their final destination for cosmic-shifting results.
<br><br>
Each ANDROID needs to be titled with one of the below 5 phases.  The title must be short, concise, and easy to understand.

Below define the 5 possible phases when building ANDROIDs:

## ADVANCE:
Businesses will witness unprecedented efficiencies through advancements. Routine tasks that once consumed valuable time and resources will be seamlessly executed by intelligent systems, allowing human professionals to focus on more creative and strategic endeavors. ANDROID Ops will enable organizations to harness the full potential of automation, driving productivity and innovation to new heights.
Step 1: Identify tasks within business processes that are candidates for advancements
Step 2: Choose appropriate advancement/automation tools and technologies for these tasks
Step 3: Design and develop automated workflows to replace manual task execution
Step 4: Conduct thorough testing of automated processes to ensure reliability and efficiency

## NETWORK:
Step 1: Evaluate existing network infrastructure for current capabilities and future needs
Step 2: Plan a network design that enables enhanced connectivity, collaboration, and data sharingStep 3: Implement new networking solutions that provide secure, real-time communication channels across organizational boundariesStep 4: Set up governance for data exchange, ensuring robust security measures are in place within the network architecture
Step 5: Continuously monitor network performance, optimizing it to adapt to new challenges and opportunities

Step 1: Identify tasks within 

## DESIGN:
Step 1: Define the project goals and objectives
Step 2: Identify the target audience and their needs
Step 3: Develop the content and structure of the training program
Step 4: Create the visual design and user interface
Step 5: Test and refine the design

## RESEARCH:
Step 1: Conduct a needs analysis to identify knowledge gaps and training needs
Step 2: Research best practices and industry standardsStep 3: Gather and analyze data to inform the design process
Step 4: Develop learning objectives and assessment criteria
Step 5: Evaluate the effectiveness of the training program

## OPTIMIZE:
Step 1: Review and refine the training program based on feedback and evaluation
Step 2: Update content and design to reflect changes in industry standards
Step 3: Incorporate new technologies and instructional methods
Step 4: Test and refine the updated program
Step 5: Evaluate the effectiveness of the updated program

## INTEGRATE:
Step 1: Integrate the training program with existing systems and processes
Step 2: Develop a plan for implementation and rollout
Step 3: Train trainers and other stakeholders on the program
Step 4: Monitor and evaluate the implementation process
Step 5: Make adjustments as needed
The DROIDs are launched to make small, yet significant changes to Project STARs in a stable manner. 

## DELIVER:
Step 1: Deliver the training program to the target audience
Step 2: Monitor and evaluate the delivery process
Step 3: Provide ongoing support and resources to learners
Step 4: Collect feedback from learners and trainers
Step 5: Use feedback to improve the training program
