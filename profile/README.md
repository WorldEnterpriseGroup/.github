## UNIVERSAL BUSINESS FRAMEWORK (UBF)
We use a scientific method known as UBF to orchestrate business incubation.  We help ideas grow into products, products to companies, and companies to enterprises with over 20 years experience in the industry using our approach.

We are working in collaboration with INSTAR Lab Inc, a Research Institute known for building strong Scientific Methods.

Read the below files to understand the UBF in more detail.
