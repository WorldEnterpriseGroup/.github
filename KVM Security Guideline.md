# Securely Managing KVM Access: A Guide for Users

This guide outlines the mandatory procedures for handling and storing KVM (Keyboard, Video, Mouse) access credentials, which include URLs, usernames, and passwords. Your adherence to these steps is critical for protecting our organization's sensitive information and maintaining our cybersecurity defenses.

---

## Why This is Vitally Important for Our Cybersecurity

Insecurely handled credentials are one of the most common ways attackers gain unauthorized access to company systems[^1][^2].

The methods described for sharing KVM access details – URLs and usernames spoken in meetings, and passwords shared in private chat – present significant security risks if not managed correctly:

### Verbal Sharing Risks (URLs, Usernames):

- Information spoken aloud can be easily overheard by unauthorized individuals.  
- Details can be misremembered or inaccurately transcribed[^3][^4].  
- If written down, temporary notes can be lost, stolen, or improperly discarded, exposing the credentials[^5].

### Private Chat Sharing Risks (Passwords):

- Chat logs can be retained indefinitely on servers or local devices[^6][^7].
- Chat accounts can be compromised, exposing shared sensitive information[^1].
- Passwords in chat can be easily copied, pasted, or screenshotted and then mishandled.

---

### Consequences of Compromise:

A single compromised KVM credential can provide an attacker with significant access to critical infrastructure, leading to:

- Severe data breaches  
- Unauthorized system changes  
- Operational disruptions  
- Financial losses  
- Damage to our company's reputation[^1][^2][^8]  

**Using a dedicated, encrypted password management solution is a fundamental practice to mitigate these risks[^9][^10][^11].**

---

## The ONLY Authorized Storage Location for KVM Credentials

To ensure the security of KVM access, the **ONLY authorized location** for storing these credentials (URL, username, and password) is within your **Microsoft Edge browser**, specifically when you are **signed in with your official company work account**.

- Microsoft Edge provides features to securely store and encrypt your passwords[^12][^13].
- This ensures credentials are encrypted and managed under company security protocols.

## Step-by-Step Instructions for Securely Handling and Storing KVM Credentials

You will receive the KVM access details in three parts. Follow these instructions carefully:

### **Part 1: URL Spoken in a Meeting**

1. **Discreetly Note**:  
   - Temporarily jot it down securely (e.g., private digital note or controlled physical note).  
   - Avoid shared whiteboards or sticky notes.

2. **Immediate Secure Entry**:
   - Open Microsoft Edge.
   - Ensure you’re signed in with your company account.
   - Go to `edge://settings/passwords`.
   - Click **"Add"** to create a new entry.
   - Enter the URL in the **"Website"** field.
   - You can leave Username/Password blank for now.
   - Click **"Save"** or **"Done"**.

3. **Securely Dispose**:  
   - Destroy physical notes (shred).
   - Delete temporary digital notes.

---

### **Part 2: Username Spoken in a Meeting**

1. **Discreetly Note**:  
   - Temporarily record it securely.

2. **Immediate Secure Entry**:
   - Open Edge and go to `edge://settings/passwords`.
   - Find your KVM URL entry and click the **three dots (...) > Edit**.
   - Enter the username.
   - Click **"Save"** or **"Done"**.

3. **Securely Dispose**:  
   - Destroy any temporary record of the username.

---

### **Part 3: Password Shared in Private Chat**

1. **Acknowledge and Prepare**:
   - Acknowledge receipt.
   - Open `edge://settings/passwords` in Edge (signed into your company account).
   - Find your KVM entry and click **"Edit"**.

2. **Copy Securely**:
   - Copy the password **directly** from the chat (don’t retype).

3. **Paste Securely into MS Edge**:
   - Paste the password into the "Password" field.

4. **Save in MS Edge**:
   - Double-check all details.
   - Click **"Save"** or **"Done"**.

5. **CRITICAL — DELETE FROM CHAT IMMEDIATELY**:
   - Delete the password message from chat.
   - Use **“delete for everyone”** or **“unsend”** if available[^6][^7].

## DO NOT Store Elsewhere

- ❌ Do **NOT** write it down.  
- ❌ Do **NOT** store in documents, text files, drafts, etc.  
- ❌ Do **NOT** leave it in your clipboard.

---

## Using and Verifying Secure Storage in Microsoft Edge (Company Account)

- Always ensure Edge is synced with your **company work account**.
- Edge will offer to save login info — use this **only after** manual setup.

### **Encryption**
- Passwords are stored **encrypted** on your device[^12].

### **Enhanced Autofill Security (Recommended)**:
1. Go to `edge://settings/passwords`.
2. Enable **"Require device password"** for autofill security.
3. Set frequency (e.g., **Always** or **Once per session**)[^12].

---

## Prohibition on Further Sharing

**Do NOT share** KVM credentials by any method (verbal, chat, email, etc.)[^1][^5].

- Access must be requested individually and properly.
- Sharing violates security and accountability protocols[^2][^15].

---

## Consequences of Non-Compliance

- Non-compliance is a **serious security risk**.
- Can lead to disciplinary action per company policy.

## Our Collective Cybersecurity Responsibility

Protecting our company’s systems is **everyone’s responsibility**.  
Follow this guide carefully. Contact **IT** if you have questions.
